# Tailwind CSS Migration

## Changes Made

- Installed Tailwind CSS and its dependencies (tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer)
- Configured Tailwind by creating `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`
- Simplified `index.css` to only include Tailwind directives
- Removed `App.css` as all styles are now handled by Tailwind
- Converted all custom CSS and inline styles in `App.tsx` to Tailwind classes

## Style Changes

- Converted all pixel-based measurements to Tailwind's spacing scale
- Implemented responsive design using Tailwind's utility classes
- Maintained the same color scheme but using Tailwind's color palette where possible
- Added hover states for buttons using Tailwind's hover variants
- Implemented transitions using Tailwind's transition utilities
- Maintained custom colors for dice-specific elements using Tailwind's arbitrary value syntax (e.g., `[#8884d8]`)

## Benefits

- Reduced CSS bundle size by removing unused styles
- Improved maintainability by using standardized utility classes
- Better development experience with predictable styling patterns
- Easier responsive design implementation
- Reduced context switching between CSS files and components
